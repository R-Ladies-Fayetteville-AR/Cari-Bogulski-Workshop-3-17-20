# Cari-Bogulski-Workshop-3-17-20
Cari presented on data cleaning and some of what she does working for the UAMS Northwest Campus Community Health and Research. In particular, she talked about program evaluation as an interesting alt-ac possibility that she hadn't heard of when she was in graduate school.
